# Analysis-of-market-promotion-using-multiple-linear-regression
We will be analyzing a small business' historical marketing promotion data. Each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion where their business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales.

To address the business request, we will conduct multiple linear regression using below steps:

* Exploring and cleaning data
* Using plots and descriptive statistics to select the independent variables
* Creating a fitting multiple linear regression model
* Checking model assumptions
* Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders
